# PraxisCORE v6

PraxisCORE is a modular JVM runtime for cyberphysical programming, supporting
real-time coding of real-time systems. It is the heart of [PraxisLIVE][praxislive].
With a distributed forest-of-actors architecture, runtime code changes and
comprehensive introspection, PraxisCORE brings aspects of Erlang, Smalltalk and
Extempore into the Java world ... a powerful platform for media processing, data
visualisation, sensors, robotics, IoT, and lots more!
